## ðŸ“Œ Notes

Web App (apps/web) handles both the frontend dashboard and backend API routes, including authentication, presigned uploads, and database logging.

CLI and Browser Extension upload directly to S3; the web app orchestrates requests and stores metadata.

Each subfolder/package (cli, extension, packages/*) is independently deployable.
